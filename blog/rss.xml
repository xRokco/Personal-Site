    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not good at dealing with loneliness. I really struggle with being alone, no matter how much time I seem to get to practice being alone. And when I’m by myself I need to have all my senses bombarded by content just to try distract me. Even right now while writing this I have a podcast playing in the background and a basketball game on the TV. So afraid I am of having to think about my own existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early January I decided I wanted to start going to the cinema again. When in college I used to go a couple of times a week to kill time during the weekdays, when tickets were cheap, but in the last two years I managed to lose all interest in films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never found going to the cinema to be particularly social endeavors. Many people won’t dream of a solo trip to a film, but really, when it comes down to it, you will be sitting in a dark room silently for two hours. No reason you can’t do it by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to the movies also seems to be one of the few things that does completely distract me from my own thoughts for its duration. I get to sit by myself for over two hours, completely focused on a single thing, without feeling compelled to refresh a news or social media app. It’s a refreshing feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with this few hours of escapist bliss comes an equally powerful comedown. The 11pm walk home through a chilly, empty city while all I have to think about is the movie I’ve just been to and the fact I don’t have anyone to share my opinion of it with is painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, this post-cinema melancholy doesn’t seem to stop me from using my cinema pass by myself. I’ve done 13 cinema trips in the last month, all but two by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see my surface level thoughts on those movies, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://letterboxd.com/Rokco/films/diary/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rocket’s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the modern burger joint spin-off of Eddie Rocket’s, which has lately been trialling a new style of burger in their Baggot Street restaurant. These burgers are &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. Very similar in style to Wowburger or Five Guys or all those American places everyone likes, which is a good thing. These are the best style burger. Not as many topping choices as the previously mentioned places, and the chips are only ok, but these are my favourite burgers in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐⭐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smokin Bones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This place really surprised me. I thought it looked like a fairly ordinary, mediocre BBQ place and so skipped it for ages. I wish I hadn’t. The White Alabama wings are literally all I think about right now. Maybe I’ll get some tonight? And you know when you buy a takeaway and it comes with two free sides and you get the corn on the cob because you just want a bit of everything even though you have no intention of actually eating it? Well, the corn on the cob is fucken delicious! And the mac ‘n’ cheese!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haven’t even bought chips from this place yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fish Shack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty small menu, but it did the job. I got the fried calamari, which was nice. Chips were good too but there’s not too much more to say about a place like this. Will probably go back here and get a sandwich or something, they look a bit more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Boojum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look it’s still just the best burrito in Dublin, but I’d never get it for dinner from Deliveroo any more. There’s always one around the corner so just go there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐⭐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;KFC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is a guilty pleasure but sometimes you just want a big ole bucket of chicken. This is still the best for that I think, except for maybe Hillbilly’s. But only the chicken (and gravy) is actually worthwhile. Sides are garb, you can’t even get Coke, burgers are mediocre. Just get a bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ciao&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These pizza’s are OK. Nice most of the time but I’ve had the odd bad one. Honestly would probably never order this place from Deliveroo, but I do live like 1 minute away so just walk there and save the €3 delivery. If it wasn’t for that I’d probably never eat one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beshoff Bros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty grand fish and chips, but the best part of Beshoff’s is the Seafood Delight Box, and they don’t offer that on Deliveroo so I would never bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Subway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, it’s Subway? I once just really wanted one so ordered one? That’s usually not a good sign as the amount of Subway I eat directly corresponds to my depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eddie Rocket’s Diner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Eddie Rocket’s, I only order from here when I want that awful cheese sauce they smother on their bacon cheese fries and hotdogs, which is fairly often actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Saburritos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ex and I used to order from here when we wanted Mexican that wasn’t on a plasticy tent sized tortilla. Saburritos offer nachos and quesadillas and other things which are nice, but I have it on good authority that it is not good Mexican food (just slightly better than most other places).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crackbird&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I want some more expensive, more strongly flavoured fried check then this is a good place. Food can be a little too crispy for me or something. Batter seems a bit caramelized, but it’s always tasted good. Tiny menu though so you’ll only be going for one of their two chicken options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐⭐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nando’s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly the Fino Pita is literally the perfect piece of food so I don’t have anything bad to say about this place, despite the reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐⭐.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Camden Rotisserie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovely onion rings, but I think the night I ordered and ate three portions was the night I stopped liking them. Like when you drink too many warm cans of Bulmers as a 16 year old and now it makes you gag? Food otherwise is grand but nothing amazing, except for the onion rings which are both delicious and revolting to me at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pitt Bros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s alright BBQ. Found the food arrived a bit cold, but that might not be their fault. Probably would never order over Smokin Bones again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Klaw The Seafood Cafe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while now, but I didn’t have a good experience with this place. Food was expensive, and I didn’t like it very much in the end. Though the macaroni cheese was really poor. And then it had the audacity to stink the room up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hanleys Cornish Pasties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice to get for lunch. I just love pastry so these are always going to be nice. Steak and Gravy was better than Beef and Stilton though. But two of them was also too much for any meal. Arrives very quickly too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other restauants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of other places I’ve ordered from but literally can’t remember what I thought. They were probably fine but nothing special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chai Yo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sanuk Thai&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embassy Grill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Al Boschetto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tung Sing (Cork)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Royal Thai (Amsterdam)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sea Salt And Chocolate (Amsterdam)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yuan Ming Yuan (Cork)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aussie BBQ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fresca&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ristorante Rossini (Cork)&lt;/li&gt;

This leads to some confusion between customers and support, because most of the time the customer says the acronym for one service but is actually talking about another service.

&lt;td&gt;Although I avoid this acronym most of the time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;CLB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Classic Load Balancer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The sort of new name for the regular old ELBs, as opposed to new ALBs. But most people still just call them ELBs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;EC2&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Elastic File System&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;ECS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Elastic Container Service&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Until recently called EC2 Container Service, the release of Fargate means dropping the EC2 and replacing it with Elastic. ECS is constantly mixed up with EC2 by customers&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ECR&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Elastic Container Repository&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ELB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Elastic Load Balancer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not&lt;/strong&gt; Elastic Beanstalk&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;EBS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Elastic Block Store&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOT Elastic Beanstalk.&lt;/strong&gt; This is by far the worst offender.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;IAM&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Identity and Access Management&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon Machine Image&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;AMI&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Amazon Machine Image&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;See above&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;ENI&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Elastic Network Interface&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Depending on your native tongue, you might pronounce the letter E the same way English speaking people pronounce the letter A, meaning AMI and ENI sound very similar coming from an Italian person’s mouth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;OW&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;OpsWorks&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;RDS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Relational Database System&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;R53&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Route 53&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;S3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Simple Storage Service&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SES&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Simple Email Service&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SNS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Simple Notification Service&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SQS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Simple Queue Service&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;VPC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Virtual Private Cloud&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;KMS&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Key Management Service&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope all is clear now, until AWS releases a bunch of new services.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a position I’ve always been incredibly proud he’s held, even when I was quite as socialist as I am now. It’s an unpaid role that brings him a little satisfaction in a job otherwise baron of it. He’s a mid level civil servant in the Property Registration Authority, and the whole building is strongly unionised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, what jobs aren’t unionised, and why aren’t they?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My job isn’t, Cloud Support specifically. And I can’t really think of any jobs in the technical sector in Ireland that have a strong union presence. Granted, I don’t think I particularly need a union right now, but is it wise to ignore their usefulness? Unions aren’t just for organising massive strikes, there are probably plenty of people who feel they were unfairly dismissed from a tech company and had no idea who to go to or how to go about fighting the sacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about the types of work which isn’t known to have a union presence brought me to a somewhat distressing realisation - it’s all “new” work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the large companies and corporations who have popped up or come to Ireland in the last 50 years do not seem to have a strong union presence, this includes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tech sector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pharmaceutical companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overseas grocery stores (like Lidl and Aldi, Tesco being the exception)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large fast food chains (like McDonalds or Dominos)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only big unions for modern jobs I can really think of is in aerospace - cabin crew, ground crew and pilots all have quite strong unions, but this probably stems from the first airlines in this country being government owned (and pretty much all government run companies will be unionised).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are people less interested in unions than the 70s? Are companies getting better at stopping them from getting a large backing in certain areas? Do people just feel like they don’t need them any more? Or is this just a cultural trickling down, from the United States, of their attitudes towards trade unions in the 21st century?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vitriol spat at the Luas, train and bus drivers over the last few years whenever they striked, both by the media and the general working class public, makes me think the bad influence of the States is at least partly to blame.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[I'm learning AWS deployment services]]></title><description><![CDATA[Well, you’d hope I actually know them, seeing as I’m working for AWS as a Cloud Support Associate in the Deployment team, right?

Being in Deployment means dealing with some of AWS’s most interesting services such as CloudFormation, EC2 Container Service, CodePipeline and OpsWorks, but when I started I barely had a clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I interned here last year I was in the same team, but the queue was pretty baron - we had a lot of very good engineers and the services were still only starting to get popular. I also only did CloudFormation and Elastic Beanstalk cases back then from deployment, which are fairly simple services compared to the others. Otherwise, I was falling back on only doing general Linux cases otherwise. AWS feels a lot busier these days, and there’s always a case to be done, and it’s more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning the new services has been great! I wish I had done so when I was doing nothing for the summer, or even better, last year when I was actually interning. This blog is probably the biggest achievement of anything non-experimental I’ve done yet using the AWS services (that is to say, I have some more technically impressive, proof-of-concept projects around, but none as usable or demonstrable as this blog).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Series of Tubes (or Pipes)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog, today, was finally moved off UCC Netsoc hardware onto AWS infrastructure. More than that though, it now uses a probably unnecessary pipelining and continuous integration service to ease building, deploying and updating it. Completely unneeded, but pretty cool none the less.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much all my sites; &lt;a href=&quot;http://rokco.org&quot;&gt;rokco.org&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://movies.rokco.org&quot;&gt;my film site&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stijl.cc&quot;&gt;stijl.cc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dedz.club&quot;&gt;dEdZ.club&lt;/a&gt; as well as this blog use CodePipeline and Elastic Beanstalk to handle deployment. These sites are all very, very simple static HTML sites, so it’s pretty unwarranted to use these tools, but it is very slick, convenient and, most of all, it is free - you only pay for the actual EC2 computing services you use, the privileged of using CodePipeline or Beanstalk itself is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don’t want to sound like some AWS shill (they do employ me after all), so I suppose I should say that I have no experience with any other, external, non-AWS services that do a similar job. So if you are in the market for a CI/pipelining service, shop around before taking my advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the sites listed above, sans this blog, the setup is very simple - CodePipeline is connected to the master branch of each Github repo and, when a change (any change), is pushed to master it redeploys onto Elastic Beanstalk automatically. No further actions needed by me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have or need a test/dev/staging environment for these projects, but they are easily setup with CodePipeline. You can add as many stages as you want really, and I have written CloudFormation templates which create Pipelines with Dev, Staging and Prod stages, and which all require different verifications before changes can be moved onto the next phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What about for less simple sites?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is the least simple site I have, even though it is still a static site. This blog is built with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/&quot;&gt;GatsbyJS&lt;/a&gt;, which is a React native static site generator with Node and other things. I don’t really know. All I know is I write this blog post in Markdown, run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gatsby build&lt;/code&gt; and then get a static html file which I can serve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before today, the workflow was what I just typed above followed by copying these static html files via FTP onto a server. This wasn’t convenient. I didn’t like it. All the ease of being able to write in Markdown was nullified. May as well have used Vim to edit a html template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CodeBuild (and CodePipeline) changed that. Now CodeBuild does the building! I start a blog post in the same way as before - write it in Markdown. Then, instead of building it I push it to my Git repo. CodePipeline sees this push and starts working. CodePipeline’s first stage is a Build stage which is implemented with CodeBuild which runs a couple of commands, gets the output (the static html files), and then deploys only these to an Elastic Beanstalk environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the buildspec.yml file, the config file which CodeBuild uses to know which commands to run in order to generate the static html files. It installs gatsby and then runs the build process. The output is everything (**/*) in the public/ directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;version: 0.2
phases:
  install:
    commands:
      - touch .npmignore
      - npm install -g gatsby
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - npm install
  build:
    commands:
      - npm run build
artifacts:
  base-directory: public
  files:
    - &amp;quot;**/*&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These files are then deployed to a PHP Elastic Beanstalk environment (even though no PHP is used), without me having to do any fiddly moving of files around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this automation. I find it cool, despite how very simple it is. This post doesn’t even begin to mention the other bonus features you get for using AWS - the alarms, monitoring, load balancers, scalability, automation and security benefits offered can’t really be easily beaten (and believe me, I don’t say these kind things out of love for my company).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Let's Talk about Rounders (and poker)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Over the last few months I’ve spent a lot of time rediscovering old hobbies and finding new ones in order to try move on with my life.

This has been really enjoyable because of all the free time I currently have to pursue them. Since moving back to Waterford at the start of summer I have started obsessing over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overwatch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Path of Exile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark Souls III&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web development stuff and this blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even Dota 2 again (a bit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Poker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one in that list is the big one, though. I’ve always loved Holdem. Since I started playing with family when I was ~13, and played for play money on Zynga Poker as a teenager I’d always wish I’d been able to play it more. And only a couple of weeks ago I realised I could! I started to watch a huge amount of poker, streams of people playing online, old episodes of High Stakes Poker and Vlogs and Youtube videos by professional players. I was amazed by just how in depth the concepts and strategy was, and just how many resources there were available, so it made learning it a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t really want to talk about poker though, or how I’ve been getting on. Maybe another post for that. I really wanted to give my thoughts on Rounders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rounders - that poker movie with Matt Damon&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rounders is a 1998 movie starring Matt Damon, Ed Norton and John Malkovich. In a word, it’s &lt;em&gt;ok&lt;/em&gt;. Not great, but there aren’t many other enjoyable poker movies out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Damon is his usual charming self, playing &lt;em&gt;Mike McDermott&lt;/em&gt; a slightly less extreme version of his Good Will Hunting character - brilliant, talented (this time as a poker player), but refusing to perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Norton is Mike’s best friend, &lt;em&gt;Worm&lt;/em&gt;, just out of prison and the most annoying human character I’ve ever seen in a movie ever. He does his best to fuck up his life, and in turn Mikes’s, throughout the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Malkovich is a Russian mobster, &lt;em&gt;Teddy KGB&lt;/em&gt;, who owns a poker club and is also a talented card player. Malkovich puts on a ridiculous accent/voice for his character that it’s difficult to focus on what he’s saying when he’s talking, but at least it gave us &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jUBbCgMWmE&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; famous scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yes but how well does Rounders respect poker?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely the most interesting thing about the movie. The answer to the above question is, in my opinion, pretty well. When Rounders is talking about poker it’s not like CSI talking about hacking, for instance, and while it’s not perfect it does a pretty good job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also doesn’t just talk about Holdem. While Holdem is definitely the biggest game in the movie, it is aware that games like Stud, Draw and PLO exist, which is nice of them. It also uses a lot of terminology I recognise, even though the film is nearly 20 years old and some of the phrases I didn’t understand might be simply old-fashioned (the term Rounders itself being one of these unfamiliar terms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This biggest weakness I think the movie has about accurately representing poker I think is how it showed &lt;em&gt;skillful play&lt;/em&gt;. The couple of climax moments throughout the movie generally revolved around &lt;em&gt;cooler&lt;/em&gt; hands. &lt;em&gt;Cooler&lt;/em&gt; hands are hands where both players cards are &lt;em&gt;really good&lt;/em&gt;, and the loser of the cooler is generally really unlucky. For example, if you have a flush (five cards of the same suit), and one of your cards is an Ace, you generally have &lt;em&gt;the Nuts&lt;/em&gt;. You almost never fold this hand. If the guy against you keeps raising you keep putting money in, right? You’re pretty much guaranteed to win - your opponent must have a worse flush, or is trying to bluff you off this pot, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, sometimes your opponent is just lucky enough to get a better hand. It would usually be silly to play around this and lay down your nut flush. These cooler hands don’t really show much skill - you got lucky, your opponent got even luckier and loads of money changed hands because of it. It happens. For what it’s worth, here’s a hand I won the other day - we were both all in after the Turn, him with the nut flush, me with the quads. You can’t predict this, it’s just unfortunate (for him, I was pleased).&lt;/p&gt;

        alt=&quot;Cooler&quot;
        title=&quot;While I had quads, an extremely unlikely hand, the chance that his flush was beat in the end was actually pretty high. If I had a 2 or just a single 5 I still would have won with a full house. All the chips were already in before the second 2 appeared, though, so it had no effect on the decision making.&quot;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the really interesting hands to watch are when a player &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; lay a huge hand down. You can go on Youtube and find so many clips of players like Phil Ivey folding when he has a big set or some other massive hand because he reads that his opponent has him beat. Being able to remove the emotion and act logically even though you have an amazing hand is aa much more interesting display of skill than being dealt AA while your opponent gets KK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is never really gone over in the movie, and maybe that’s fair. It would be much harder for casual audiences to appreciate this type of skill - winning with really good cards is a lot more fun than folding them - but I think that it could have been easily explained why &lt;em&gt;hero folding&lt;/em&gt; is so impressive, especially as Mike does narrate throughout and explains his plays and the rules of poker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that’s all I thought I guess. What an incoherent mess I am.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Matt's Film Site]]></title><description><![CDATA[Link to site.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I built this little site so people would have an easier time choosing a movie to watch, especially when they are itching for a specific genre or type of movie. Sometimes you want a brainless action flick, sometimes you want to seem cultured and watch some Terrence Malick type film. Hopefully, for instance, if you’ve just finished &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1060277/&quot;&gt;Cloverfield&lt;/a&gt; and you’re asking “More like this?”, this site will point you to something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468492/&quot;&gt;The Host&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; As for finding a way to watch the movies, can’t really help you there… maybe try &lt;a href=&quot;https://netflix.com&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;? (or ask me really nicely).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This site is really simple, and the first version was built months ago when I barely knew how to programme (I’ve learned most of what I know in the last 14 months) and most of the core functionality is unchanged since then, so don’t expect perfect code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; All the movies and categories are stored in a big JSON file which populates the HTML. The JSON file is generated by another JavaScript file that calls the IMDb API and does some other text manipulation things. At the moment, all poster images have to be downloaded by me manually, but maybe I can try out some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omdbapi.com/&quot;&gt;better API&lt;/a&gt; to take care of posters in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suggestions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If you have some ideas for categories to add, or find a bug in the site, or just want to add some more movies you think are under-represented, please email me at matt@rokco.org.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Initial Release of my Beautiful New Tab]]></title><description><![CDATA[Version 1.1     Yesterday I released v1.0 of my Chrome extension, and after finding a bug immediately after publishing it on the web store…]]></description><link>https://rokco.org/blog/beautiful-new-tab-initial-release/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://rokco.org/blog/beautiful-new-tab-initial-release/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2017 18:35:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Version 1.1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yesterday I released v1.0 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/beautiful-new-tab/bailppllbndlpphoipdchcmiiefhelfh&quot;&gt;my Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt;, and after finding a bug immediately after publishing it on the web store, I uploaded a fixed version 1.1 shortly afterwards. Version 1.2 is currently being published with another minor fix too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means it’s done™! Not really though. It’s not perfect and it does need some work, but it’s polished enough to release now at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know - it changes the Chrome new tab page to another, much prettier page. It shows a random image from Unsplash, which are almost always gorgeous, as well as the date and time and the temperature and weather, which is pulled from OpenWeatherMap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to install if you’re on Chrome - just click “Add To Chrome” from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/beautiful-new-tab/bailppllbndlpphoipdchcmiiefhelfh&quot;&gt;extension’s page&lt;/a&gt; to download it. That’s it, but you’ll probably want to change its options, like which links it displays, from the options page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What isn’t good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, it’s not perfect, particularly, the icon really needs changing. I’m just using a material cloud icon at the moment which doesn’t really make any sense or fit or anything but look I’m no graphic designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could use a better name too, I wasn’t very creative with &lt;em&gt;Beautiful New Tab&lt;/em&gt;. I was jokingly thinking of &lt;em&gt;Inertia&lt;/em&gt; because it’s a play on &lt;em&gt;Momentum&lt;/em&gt; (the popular competitor extension).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a good name suggestions seriously let me know (matt at rokco dot org), or if you want to donate an icon I would obviously be very grateful :smile:.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anything else?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can look at the source on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xRokco/Beautiful-New-Tab&quot;&gt;my GitHub&lt;/a&gt; if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might make a more personal blog post, or a post about what else I’ve been doing or working on later or tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[General Matt Update]]></title><description><![CDATA[This was meant to be long, heartfelt and honest, but the excitement I just experienced has flattened all that.

&lt;h2&gt;University&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished college today. It took me five years but I finally did it. I don’t expect to need to do any repeats, but a 1.1 is looking out of sight at the same time. The exam today went pretty well, and I only had three exams this semester so you can expect they would go alright at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chrome Extension&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have made good progress on the Chrome extension I’ve been working on. I now have production Unsplash API access. Unfortunately they have deprecated category random images which is disappointing, but the extension will live on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll make a blog post about the Chrome extension when I release it on the app store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tonight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight was interesting, I guess. I’ve been drinking since 3pm, and it’s 3am now, so excuse me if this is terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started off standard enough - Vic, Edison, Silly Goose. Essentially a tour of The Bars of Matt’s Last Relationship. We ended up back in The Vic, where me and a pal hit it off with a couple of random people there. Unfortunately, the person I hit it off with needed to work early the next morning so headed off early enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Vic we went to An Brog, continuing the trend of reliving better times for me. In Brog I was hit by a horrific feeling of dread and paranoia. I felt it easier for everyone (myself especially) if I just head home, which I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My phone ran out of battery two minutes from Vic Mills. Classic, but no real issue surely. I arrive at the front gate, stick my key in and… nothing? The LED blinks red, rather than green. I try my key card a few more times but nothing changes. I know what’s happened obviously. My lease was up today so my key stopped working despite my agreement to an extra two days stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knocked on reception but there was no sign of life there. I finally get let into the compound by a girl doing her laundry. The only reason i could get into my building is because the lock on the front door had broken a few days before, so I head up to my floor, but obviously can’t let myself into my apartment. I sit down in the corridor and plug in my phone so I can ring security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While waiting for the phone to charge I started messing with the lock - I’d broken through these locks before, but usually when the door swang the other way which made them way easier. I still decided to try fiddle with the lock and maybe I could get in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 20 minutes of fiddling, I manage to get the lock to give with two plastic credit card type cards. Knowing how the lock worked made this was easier, but using some brute force it was possible to crack the lock open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got in and taped the lock open so for the next two days I won’t even need a key.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My New New Tab Page]]></title><description><![CDATA[Yesterday I pushed an update to my small Chrome extension.

The extension changes chrome://newtab to a different HTML page, with a (hopefully) beautiful image, a big clock, the current temperature and weather for the user’s location, and a selection of links to my most used websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d always hated the default Chrome new tab page - the eight autogenerated links at the bottom of the page seemingly never went to the sites I wanted to go to, and most of the time their thumbnails were ugly or empty. To make it even worse, until &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/google/2017/05/08/google-chrome-new-page-asymmetry-fixed&quot;&gt;it was fixed&lt;/a&gt; the other day, the Google search bar was &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/google/2017/05/03/google-chrome-new-tab-not-symmetrical/&quot;&gt;asymetrical&lt;/a&gt; (not that anyone ever used that bar when the omnibox was autohighlighted anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to make a new new tab page. &lt;/p&gt;

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My extension pulls a random image from &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt; and weather data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://openweathermap.org/&quot;&gt;OpenWeatherMap&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, for an image to look good on modern high resolution displays, they need to be very big. I use an XPS 13 with a 3200x1800 resolution display so even 1920x1080 images don’t look quite sharp enough for me. Large images take time to download and display though, which is an issue. Initially, whenever the user opens a new tab an AJAX request was made to Unsplash and the random image download and set as the page background. The image would usually stutter and barely finish loading by the time the user had navigated away from the new tab page. With images that never finished loading I had essentially replaced my old new tab page with a plain black one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get around this, I decided to cache an image when the user visited the new tab page, and then display the image that was cached when the user visits the new tab page the next time. This meant that all loading was done in the background and all displaying of images was done from locally stored images, so there was virtually no delay on the image being displayed. The logic worked like this -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the user opens a new tab page check if there’s an image cached&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is, get the cached image and display it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If no image previously cached (could be the first time they visit the new tab page after installing the extension), then show a local backup image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After displaying an image, send an AJAX request to download a new image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the image from the AJAX request and cache it for the next time the user opens a new tab page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few kinks with this plan, though - Chrome’s localStorage API only accepts saving strings, not images, so I’d have to convert my image to a base64 URL for saving. Fortunately, I have worked enough with the HTML5 Canvas element to know how to do this. Chrome’s localStorage API also seems to have a 5MB limit on it per origin. There is an unlimitedStorage permission that is meant to remove this cap, but it never seemed to work for me, and many sites cite a 10MB limit for Chrome normally, which again never worked for me. This storage limit was pretty minor though - while some images pulled from Unsplash could be larger than 5MB, especially after being converted to base64 (usually about 33% bigger than the original image), these were pretty rare, and if the image failed to save then the next time the user opens a new tab it would just show one of the equally pretty backup images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one other big problem with the above logic though, which I proudly fixed with the update I just pushed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Converting an image to base64, especially large images, takes a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time. Most of the time, the user would have navigated away from the new tab page before the image has a chance to be processed and cached, so in 90% of situations a backup image gets shown. This was fairly easy to fix, but required I take more advantage of the things Chrome extensions offer, namely, running in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function to get, convert and save the images was moved to another script file which was allowed to run in the background. Then whenever a new tab was opened a message was passed from the main JavaScript file to call the image caching function. If the user moves away from the new tab page the function will continue running and (almost always) guarantee to cache an image, before going idle again until a new tab page is opened again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s still lots to work on if I ever want to think about publishing this extension though, I need -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A settings page to let users change the links on it, and change things like Celcius to F, and 24 hour clock to 12 hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A proper API key for Unsplash and OWM needs to be applied for, instead of using a developer one just for myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way the image is displayed in the HTML needs to be improved to better handle weirdly shaped images and vertical monitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The image info sections needs a rewrite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many more minor changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to try it out from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xRokco/New-Tab&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; - there’s installation instructions in the readme. Alternatively, you could help me think of a name for it. New new tab page isn’t a great one.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[I have an exam tomorrow...]]></title><description><![CDATA[But instead I spent most of a night setting this little thing up.
