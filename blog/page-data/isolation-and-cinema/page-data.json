I really struggle with being alone, no matter how much time I seem to get to practice being alone. And when I’m by myself I need to have all my senses bombarded by content just to try distract me. Even right now while writing this I have a podcast playing in the background and a basketball game on the TV. So afraid I am of having to think about my own existence.</p>\n<p>Early January I decided I wanted to start going to the cinema again. When in college I used to go a couple of times a week to kill time during the weekdays, when tickets were cheap, but in the last two years I managed to lose all interest in films.</p>\n<p>I never found going to the cinema to be particularly social endeavors. Many people won’t dream of a solo trip to a film, but really, when it comes down to it, you will be sitting in a dark room silently for two hours. No reason you can’t do it by yourself.</p>\n<p>Going to the movies also seems to be one of the few things that does completely distract me from my own thoughts for its duration. I get to sit by myself for over two hours, completely focused on a single thing, without feeling compelled to refresh a news or social media app. It’s a refreshing feeling.</p>\n<p>But with this few hours of escapist bliss comes an equally powerful comedown. The 11pm walk home through a chilly, empty city while all I have to think about is the movie I’ve just been to and the fact I don’t have anyone to share my opinion of it with is painful.</p>\n<p>Luckily, this post-cinema melancholy doesn’t seem to stop me from using my cinema pass by myself. I’ve done 13 cinema trips in the last month, all but two by myself.</p>\n<p>If you want to see my surface level thoughts on those movies, you can <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/Rokco/films/diary/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/-Are4snbNOE\">Photo</a> by Jack Hunter on Unsplash</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Isolation and cinema trips","date":"February 03, 2020","description":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/isolation-and-cinema/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/deliveroo-review/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Deliveroo Review"}},"next":null}}}
